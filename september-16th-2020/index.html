    <h1>Game a Day</h1>
<p>I recently stopped working a 9 to 5 job, so I decided to start playing through one game from the <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a> a day.</p>
<h3>On September 16th 2020 I'm playing:</h3>
<h2>Deeper Into Space</h2>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM4MDQ0MzMucG5n/315x250%23c/X%2FqJKT.png" alt="The cover image for the game"></p>
<p>A 2D physics based space survival/shooter, with rogue-like elements</p>
