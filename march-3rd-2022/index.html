    <h1>Game a Day</h1>
<p>I recently stopped working a 9 to 5 job, so I decided to start playing through one game from the <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a> a day.</p>
<h3>On March 3rd 2022 I'm playing:</h3>
<h2>A Hole New World</h2>

<p>Fight the hordes of Shadows that come out  from the Underworld through thousand of holes</p>
