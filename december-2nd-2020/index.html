    <h1>Game a Day</h1>
<p>I recently stopped working a 9 to 5 job, so I decided to start playing through one game from the <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a> a day.</p>
<h3>On December 2nd 2020 I'm playing:</h3>
<h2>As We Know It</h2>
